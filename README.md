### Hi there 👋

This is the GitHub profile for Sam Briggs (he/him). 📬 briggs3@uw.edu

- 🏋🏼‍♂️ I am currently interning as a Machine Learning Engineer at NASA.
- 🌞 Last summer I interned for a startup, Halosight, as a NLP/ML Engineer. 
- 🌱 I’m currently working on my MS Computational Linguistics at the University of Washington. I will graduate in December of 2023. I am currently researching
        the effectiveness of quantization methods such as QLORA used for Large Language Models (LLMs) when applied to image captioning systems such as BLIP-2. 
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on any project that involves NLP, Machine Learning and Large Language Models. If you have any ideas, hit me up!
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with my job search. If you know about any opportunities in NLP, ML, or AI don't be afraid to let me know!
- 💬 Ask me about NLP, Computational Linguistics, Machine Learning, Mathematics, or Linguistics. I enjoy thinking about all of those topics. If none of those appeal
        I also enjoy talking about sports, especially basketball and soccer. 
- ⚡ Fun fact: Not only do I enjoy talking about basketball and soccer, I also play basketball and soccer.
